## Description
**connect4** Connect Four (also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Fourplay, Four in a Row, Four in a Line and Gravitrips (in Soviet Union) ) is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a strongly solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.
The game was first sold under the famous Connect Four trademark by Milton Bradley in February 1974.
